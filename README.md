# Derinkuyu
Derinkuyu is a online multiplayer roguelike game, with biomes and procedural generation.

## Description
The name stands for [Derinkuyu underground city], an ancient underground city in Nev≈üehir, Turkey. The city was connected with other underground cities through miles of tunnels, and sheltered people in almost all ages of mankind. Life is tough when you live on a cave, and you will have to fight and interact to survive.

## How to play
Since the server is a service, client can be developed for any platform.
A browser client will be [available here] in the future.

## Installation
To configure the server side, you will need Python 3 with the following extensions:
* [Numpy 1.9.0]
* [PIL 1.1.7]
* [Noise 1.2.2]

At the moment, you only can generate maps by specifying the number of players.

### How to contribute?
The development of this game is on an early stage, so the code is a bit *effervescent*. On a few months, you will be able to contribute to this project, so stay tuned if you are interested!
